## Data-Driven Insights into User Behaviour, Brand Preference, and App Usage Patterns from Indian Mobile Behaviour

### Project Overview:

This project analyzes Indian mobile user behavior using data-driven techniques to uncover insights about app usage patterns, brand preferences, and engagement trends. With the rise of smartphone penetration and digital ecosystems, understanding these behavioral patterns enables businesses, app developers, and marketers to make informed, evidence-based decisions.

The research leverages machine learning models, statistical analysis, and exploratory data analytics (EDA) to identify user engagement patterns and classify behavior. By comparing Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) models, the project demonstrates how predictive analytics can reveal valuable behavioral insights from large-scale mobile datasets.

### Objectives:
1. To analyze large-scale mobile usage data for behavioral segmentation.

2. To identify key factors influencing app usage and brand preference.

3. To compare performance between traditional and machine learning approaches.

4. To develop a predictive model for user engagement classification.

5. To support data-driven marketing and app design strategies.

### Methodology:
The project follows a structured data analytics workflow:

1. Dataset Upload – Import Indian mobile usage dataset (CSV).

2. Data Preprocessing – Handle null values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize user engagement metrics, correlations, and trends.

4. Feature Engineering – Transform raw variables such as app usage time, data consumption, and screen-on duration.

5. Model Building – Train and test two machine learning models:

   > Baseline: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
   
   > Proposed: Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

6. Model Evaluation – Compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. Result Visualization – Confusion matrices, accuracy graphs, and feature importance plots.

### Technologies Used:

| Category             | Tools / Libraries          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Programming Language | Python                     |
| Data Analysis        | Pandas, NumPy              |
| Visualization        | Matplotlib, Seaborn        |
| Machine Learning     | Scikit-learn               |
| Data Format          | CSV                        |
| IDEs Used            | Jupyter Notebook / VS Code |

### Results Summary:
1. The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) achieved higher accuracy and robustness compared to the baseline Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB).

2. Strong correlations were observed between screen-on time, data usage, and battery drain.

3. Visualizations revealed clear differences in app usage patterns across demographics and operating systems.

4. Behavioral segmentation helped identify high-engagement and low-engagement user clusters.

5. The model’s predictions support personalized marketing, UX design, and brand strategy decisions.

### Key Insights:
> Utility-driven behavior dominates Indian users’ app preferences.

> Brand loyalty depends more on functionality than on marketing.

> Gamification and personalization significantly improve engagement.
